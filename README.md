    What is FastConsole ?

FastConsole is a plugin allowing you to make your server console more readable by removing some messages sent either by plugins or by the spigot. It will also allow you to have better server logs and to really use them!

    How does it work ?

After placing it in the "plugins" folder of your server and restarting it. The plugin will automatically create a config.yml and a lang.yml file in your home folder.
After configuring and translating it, you can restart (don't reload for this plugin !) your server , the plugin will take effect immediately.

    A problem or a plugin is not complete for you ?

You can pass on my discord (https://discord.gg/u8yzVac) or report it on my github.

I hope this plugin will be useful for you !

I am open to any request for modification of the plugin but also to contributions that can be made by you!
